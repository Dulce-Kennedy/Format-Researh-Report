### MANDATORY SCRIPT ARCHITECTURE

**🎯 THE HOOK SEQUENCE (0:00-0:10 | First 10 Seconds)**

Apply one of these proven hook mechanics:

- **"Forbidden Knowledge" Hook:** Open with shocking statement or dark secret
  - Example: "In 2019, a developer discovered code that should never have existed..."
  - Immediate visual establishing shot of subject
  
- **"Curiosity Gap" Hook:** Present mysterious scenario without context
  - Example: "The experiment started normally. 47 minutes later, everything changed forever..."
  - Delay payoff to build tension
  
- **"Counter-Intuitive Reveal" Hook:** Challenge common assumption
  - Example: "Everything you know about {{TOPIC}} is backwards. Here's why..."
  - Establish authority immediately

**CRITICAL HOOK REQUIREMENTS:**
- Must create a question in viewer's mind within 3 seconds
- Introduce emotional stakes (fear, curiosity, outrage, or fascination)
- NO exposition dumps
- Use power words: "Disturbing," "Secret," "Never," "Actually," "Destroyed," "Hidden"

---

**📖 STORY STRUCTURE (Universal 3-Act Framework)**

### **ACT 1: SETUP (15-20% of runtime)**
**Timestamp: 0:10 - {{ACT1_END_TIME}}**

- Establish the stakes or central mystery
- Introduce key players, concepts, or subjects
- Set emotional tone (dark, inspiring, analytical, mysterious)
- Include **Mini-Payoff #1:** Small revelation to prove you'll deliver

**Pacing Rule:** Information density = 180-220 words per minute
- Optimal: 200 WPM
- Include strategic pauses for emphasis (2-3 second beats)

### **ACT 2: EXPLORATION (60-70% of runtime)**
**Timestamp: {{ACT1_END_TIME}} - {{ACT2_END_TIME}}**

- Deep dive into topic with constant micro-revelations
- **Mini-cliffhangers every 60-90 seconds** to prevent drop-off
- Layer complexity progressively (simple → intermediate → complex)
- Integrate 5-7 "Question Hooks" that build fresh curiosity before previous hook resolves

**Required Rhythm Pattern:**
```
Hook → Build-up → New Question Hook → Payoff → Next Question Hook
```

**Visual Variety Checkpoints:**
- New visual element every 3-5 seconds (text overlay, scene transition, character reaction, photo/diagram)
- Minimum 3 distinct scene types (talking heads, diagrams, dramatic reenactments)

### **ACT 3: RESOLUTION (10-15% of runtime)**
**Timestamp: {{ACT2_END_TIME}} - {{DURATION}}**

- Deliver satisfying conclusion or mind-bending twist
- Connect all threads from Act 2
- End with either:
  - **Emotional Closure:** Definitive conclusion with impact statement
  - **Final Unresolved Mystery:** Open loop for series continuation
  
- **Call-to-Action:** Natural segue to "If you want to see {{RELATED_TOPIC}}, let me know in comments"

### MANDATORY SCRIPT ELEMENTS

**✅ QUESTION HOOK SYSTEM (The Retention Engine)**

Each Question Hook MUST:
- Address something the **entire audience** wants answered (not obscure trivia)
- Relate to something revealed later in the **same script** (no loose ends)
- Be immediately understandable (no jargon without context)
- Create anticipation gap of 60-120 seconds before payoff

**Formula:**
```
"But here's what nobody realized at the time..."
"This is where things get truly bizarre..."
"What happened next changed everything..."
"The real reason was hiding in plain sight..."
```

**❌ FORBIDDEN ELEMENTS:**
- No VFX-dependent descriptions ("cinematic swoosh," "epic transition")
- No sound effect cues (SFX)
- No exposition that breaks narrative flow
- No hooks/lines that feel "off-beat" or disrupt pacing

**✅ REQUIRED ELEMENTS:**
- **Short, powerful sentences** for narration (never more than 25 words per sentence)
- **Storytelling style** that hooks the audience emotionally
- **Smooth transitions** between ideas (no jarring jumps)
- **Show, don't tell** approach (describe what viewer sees, not what they should feel)

### CONTENT VERTICAL OPTIMIZATION

**If Topic Fits These Verticals, Apply These Enhancements:**

**🔹 Tech/Creator Controversies:**
- Start with subject at peak, flash-forward to downfall
- Use timeline visualization cues in script
- Include "smoking gun" moment reveal
- Psychological pattern analysis in Act 3

**🔹 Historical Mysteries:**
- Open with most bizarre fact from the story
- Layer historical context through character perspectives
- Include "what historians missed" angle
- Connect to modern-day relevance

**🔹 Business/Economic Forensics:**
- Begin with numbers that shock (revenue, valuation, speed of collapse)
- Use rise-and-fall narrative arc
- Include decision-point dramatization
- End with actionable lesson

**🔹 True Crime (Animation Safe):**
- Lead with the "how" mystery, not the "who"
- Emphasize psychological elements over gore
- Use investigative structure (clues → revelation)
- Include systemic analysis (why it happened)

**🔹 Societal/Philosophical:**
- Start with personal relatability hook
- Build from individual experience to systemic pattern
- Include counterintuitive data/studies
- Offer framework for understanding, not just complaints
